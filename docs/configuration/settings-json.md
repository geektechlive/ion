# Profile Configuration

Profiles let you define named sets of engine configuration -- extension directories and display names -- and switch between them. Profiles are stored in `~/.ion/settings.json`, separate from `engine.json`.

## File location

`~/.ion/settings.json`

## Structure

```json
{
  "engineProfiles": [
    {
      "id": "default",
      "name": "Default",
      "extensions": ["~/.ion/extensions/default"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The engine reads the `engineProfiles` array (with `harnessProfiles` as a legacy fallback).

## Profile fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the profile. Used for programmatic lookups. |
| `name` | string | Yes | Display name. Also used for lookup -- you can reference a profile by either `id` or `name`. |
| `extensions` | string[] | Yes | Paths to extension directories for this profile. Tilde (`~`) is expanded to the user's home directory. |

## How profiles are resolved

When a client starts a session, it can specify a profile by name or ID. The engine calls `FindProfile()`, which searches the `engineProfiles` array and returns the first match on either `name` or `id`.

If no profile is specified, behavior depends on the client. The desktop app typically selects a default profile on the user's behalf.

## Multiple profiles

Define multiple profiles to switch between different extension sets:

```json
{
  "engineProfiles": [
    {
      "id": "coding",
      "name": "Coding",
      "extensions": ["~/.ion/extensions/coding"]
    },
    {
      "id": "research",
      "name": "Research",
      "extensions": [
        "~/.ion/extensions/coding",
        "~/.ion/extensions/research-tools"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "minimal",
      "name": "Minimal",
      "extensions": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Model selection is handled by the `model_select` hook or per-prompt overrides, not by the profile.

## Desktop power-user overrides

The `desktop` key in `settings.json` holds desktop-harness-specific overrides. These keys are **not** exposed in the renderer Settings UI — they are power-user escape hatches for advanced scenarios. Edit `~/.ion/settings.json` directly.

**Posture**: settings.json only, no renderer UI. Per [ADR-004](../architecture/adr/004-enter-plan-mode-prose-in-harness.md)'s "Future considerations" section: "doing so would commit Ion to a UX register (multi-line editable text with placeholder validation, 'reset to default' affordance, cross-platform iOS textarea parity) it has not designed for."

### Plan mode framing overrides

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `desktop.planModePrompt` | string | `PLAN_MODE_PROMPT` constant in `prompt-pipeline.ts` | Full system prompt injected at the start of each plan-mode run. Replaces the desktop's reference prose verbatim. Empty or absent uses the desktop default. |
| `desktop.planModeSparseReminder` | string | `PLAN_MODE_SPARSE_REMINDER` constant in `prompt-pipeline.ts` | Per-turn sparse reminder injected every `planModeReminderInterval` turns during plan-mode runs. Replaces the desktop's reference text verbatim. Empty or absent uses the desktop default. |

Both keys follow the same precedence as their wire-contract counterparts (`RunOptions.PlanModePrompt` and `RunOptions.PlanModeSparseReminder`): harness-supplied value > engine default. The desktop reads these keys at session start and passes the non-empty values through on every `send_prompt` dispatch.

**Example**: Suppress the plan-mode prose entirely for a minimal planning workflow:

```json
{
  "engineProfiles": [...],
  "desktop": {
    "planModePrompt": "You are in planning mode. Write a plan to the plan file, then call ExitPlanMode.",
    "planModeSparseReminder": "Plan mode active. End with ExitPlanMode or AskUserQuestion."
  }
}
```

Cross-reference:
- [ADR-004](../architecture/adr/004-enter-plan-mode-prose-in-harness.md) — the policy/mechanism boundary that motivates these knobs
- [Plan mode prose overrides](../sessions/lifecycle.md#plan-mode-prose-overrides) — the three-layer precedence (RunOptions → hook → engine default)
- [client-commands.md#send_prompt](../protocol/client-commands.md#send_prompt) — the wire fields these settings populate
