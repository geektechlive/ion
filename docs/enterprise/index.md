# Enterprise Deployment

Enterprise configuration is the top layer in Ion Engine's four-layer config system. It sits above defaults, user config, and project config. Unlike the other layers, enterprise config is sealed -- values set at this layer cannot be weakened or overridden by lower layers.

Enterprise config is designed for IT admins who need to enforce organizational policies across a fleet of workstations running Ion Engine.

## What enterprise config controls

| Area | Controls | Reference |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Models | Allowlists, blocklists for LLM models | [Compliance](compliance.md) |
| Providers | Restrict which LLM providers can be used | [Compliance](compliance.md) |
| Tools | Allow or deny specific tools | [Compliance](compliance.md) |
| MCP servers | Allowlist/denylist for MCP server connections | [Compliance](compliance.md) |
| Hooks | Require specific hooks to be active in all sessions | [Compliance](compliance.md) |
| Permissions | Set permission mode and rules that cannot be weakened | [Sealed config](sealed-config.md) |
| Sandbox | Require sandbox, prevent disable | [Sealed config](sealed-config.md) |
| Network | Proxy settings, custom CA certificates, TLS config | [Network](network.md) |
| Telemetry | Enforce telemetry collection and export destinations | [Telemetry](telemetry.md) |
| New-conversation defaults | Mandate working directory and engine profile for new conversations; optionally lock to prevent user override | [New-conversation policy](new-conversation-policy.md) |

  }
}
```

## Deployment methods

Enterprise config can be delivered through platform-native management tools or environment variables. The engine checks sources in a defined order and uses the first one it finds.

| Platform | Primary method | Fallback |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| macOS | Managed Preferences (MDM profile) | `ION_ENTERPRISE_CONFIG` env var |
| Windows | Group Policy (registry) | `ION_ENTERPRISE_CONFIG` env var |
| Linux | System config files | `ION_ENTERPRISE_CONFIG` env var |
| All | `ION_ENTERPRISE_CONFIG` env var | -- |

See [MDM deployment](mdm.md) for platform-specific instructions.

## How sealing works

Enterprise config is not merged the same way as other layers. After the three-layer merge (defaults + user + project) completes, the enterprise layer is applied as a constraint:

- Scalar restrictions (model lists, provider lists) filter the merged result.
- Permission mode can only be tightened, never loosened.
- Array fields (MCP lists, dangerous patterns) are unioned with lower layers.
- Telemetry settings, once enabled, cannot be disabled.

See [Sealed config](sealed-config.md) for the full sealing semantics.

- [Sealed config](sealed-config.md) -- sealing semantics and override prevention
- [Network](network.md) -- proxy, CA certificates, and TLS
- [Telemetry](telemetry.md) -- telemetry targets, OTEL, and privacy
- [Compliance](compliance.md) -- model, provider, tool, and MCP controls
- [New-conversation policy](new-conversation-policy.md) -- mandate working directory and engine profile for new conversations
