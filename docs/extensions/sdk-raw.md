# Building Extensions in Any Language

Extensions are subprocesses. Any language that can read stdin and write stdout can be an extension. This guide covers the raw JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol you need to implement.

## Requirements

Your extension binary must:

1. Read NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) from stdin
2. Write NDJSON to stdout
3. Handle the `init` method and respond with tool/command registrations
4. Handle `hook/*`, `tool/*`, and `command/*` methods
5. Be named `main` and placed in the extension directory
6. Be executable (`chmod +x main`)

Write debug output to stderr. Never write non-JSON to stdout.

## Minimal implementation

Here is a complete extension in Python that registers one tool and handles hooks:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys


def respond(msg_id, result):
    msg = json.dumps({"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": msg_id, "result": result})
    sys.stdout.write(msg + "\n")
    sys.stdout.flush()


def respond_error(msg_id, code, message):
    msg = json.dumps({"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": msg_id, "error": {"code": code, "message": message}})
    sys.stdout.write(msg + "\n")
    sys.stdout.flush()


def handle_init(msg_id, params):
    respond(msg_id, {
        "tools": [
            {
                "name": "word_count",
                "description": "Count words in a text string",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "text": {"type": "string", "description": "Text to count words in"}
                    },
                    "required": ["text"]
                }
            }
        ],
        "commands": {}
    })


def handle_tool(msg_id, tool_name, params):
    if tool_name == "word_count":
        text = params.get("text", "")
        count = len(text.split())
        respond(msg_id, {"content": f"Word count: {count}"})
    else:
        respond_error(msg_id, -32601, f"Tool not found: {tool_name}")


def handle_hook(msg_id, hook_name, params):
    # Handle hooks you care about, return null for the rest
    if hook_name == "session_start":
        sys.stderr.write("[word-count] session started\n")

    respond(msg_id, None)


def main():
    for line in sys.stdin:
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue

        try:
            msg = json.loads(line)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            continue

        msg_id = msg.get("id")
        method = msg.get("method", "")
        params = msg.get("params", {})

        if method == "init":
            handle_init(msg_id, params)
        elif method.startswith("hook/"):
            handle_hook(msg_id, method[5:], params)
        elif method.startswith("tool/"):
            # Strip _ctx from params before passing to tool handler
            tool_params = {k: v for k, v in params.items() if k != "_ctx"}
            handle_tool(msg_id, method[5:], tool_params)
        elif method.startswith("command/"):
            respond(msg_id, None)
        else:
            respond_error(msg_id, -32601, f"Method not found: {method}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Save as `main`, make executable, and place in your extension directory:

```bash
chmod +x main
```

## Init handshake

The first message the engine sends is always `init`. You must respond with your tool and command registrations.

**Request:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"init","params":{"extensionDir":"/path/to/ext","workingDirectory":"/path/to/project"}}
```

**Response:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"tools":[{"name":"my_tool","description":"...","parameters":{}}],"commands":{"my-cmd":{"description":"..."}}}}
```

If you have no tools or commands, respond with an empty result:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{}}
```

## Hook calls

The engine sends `hook/<name>` calls during the session. The params always include a `_ctx` field with session context. Hook-specific data is merged at the top level.

**Request:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"hook/tool_call","params":{"_ctx":{"cwd":"/project"},"toolName":"Bash","toolID":"abc","input":{"command":"ls"}}}
```

**Response patterns:**

Return null for hooks you don't handle:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"result":null}
```

Return a value to override behavior (hook-specific):

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"result":{"block":true,"reason":"Blocked"}}
```

You can include events to emit alongside your result:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"result":{"events":[{"type":"engine_notify","message":"Tool blocked","level":"warn"}]}}
```

## Tool calls

When the LLM invokes your tool, the engine sends `tool/<name>`. The `_ctx` field is present in params; strip it before processing.

**Request:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":10,"method":"tool/word_count","params":{"_ctx":{"cwd":"/project"},"text":"hello world"}}
```

**Response:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":10,"result":{"content":"Word count: 2"}}
```

Return `isError: true` to signal failure:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":10,"result":{"content":"Failed to process","isError":true}}
```

## Command calls

**Request:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":15,"method":"command/my-cmd","params":{"_ctx":{"cwd":"/project"},"args":"some args"}}
```

**Response:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":15,"result":null}
```

## Sending notifications to the engine

Write notifications (no `id` field) to stdout to emit events or send messages:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ext/emit","params":{"type":"engine_notify","message":"Done","level":"info"}}
```

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ext/send_message","params":{"text":"Processing complete"}}
```

## Sending requests to the engine

For process management and agent dispatch, send requests with an `id` field. The engine will write a response back on your stdin.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100001,"method":"ext/register_process","params":{"name":"worker","pid":54321,"task":"running"}}
```

Read the response from stdin:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100001,"result":{"ok":true}}
```

**Recalling an agent:**

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100002,"method":"ext/recall_agent","params":{"name":"researcher","reason":"no longer needed"}}
```

Response:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100002,"result":{"found":true}}
```

The `found` field is `true` when a running background dispatch was found and recalled, `false` otherwise.

### ext/get_session_memory

Returns the current session memory content.

**Request:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ext/get_session_memory","params":{}}
```

**Response:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"content":"## Current Task\nWorking on..."}}
```

### ext/set_session_memory

Replaces the session memory with custom content and persists it to disk.

**Request:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ext/set_session_memory","params":{"content":"Custom summary..."}}
```

**Response:**
```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{}}
```

Your extension needs to handle both incoming requests (from engine) and incoming responses (to your outgoing requests) on the same stdin stream. Distinguish them by checking whether the message has a `method` field (incoming request) or not (response to your request).

## Dispatch lifecycle notifications

When a background dispatch is active (started with `ext/dispatch_agent` and `background: true`), the engine sends lifecycle notifications *to* the extension on stdin. These are JSON-RPC notifications (no `id` field) that your extension receives:

| Method | When | Payload |
|--------|------|---------|
| `dispatch_complete` | Background agent finished successfully | `{name, output, exitCode, elapsed, cost, inputTokens, outputTokens, sessionId}` |
| `dispatch_error` | Background agent failed | `{name, message, exitCode, elapsed}` |
| `dispatch_recall` | Background agent was recalled | `{name, reason, elapsed, toolCount}` |
| `dispatch_tool_start` | Tool invocation began in child | `{name, toolName, toolId}` |
| `dispatch_tool_end` | Tool completed in child | `{name, toolName, toolId, content}` |
| `dispatch_tool_error` | Tool errored in child | `{name, toolName, toolId, content}` |
| `dispatch_usage` | Token usage update from child | `{name, inputTokens, outputTokens, cumulativeInputTokens, cumulativeOutputTokens, cumulativeCost}` |
| `dispatch_text_delta` | Streaming text from child | `{name, delta, accumulated}` |
| `dispatch_plan_proposal` | Child agent proposed a plan (called ExitPlanMode) | `{name, agentId, planFilePath, planSlug, planRequested}` |

Example incoming notification:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"dispatch_complete","params":{"name":"researcher","output":"Found 12 TODOs","exitCode":0,"elapsed":8.3,"cost":0.012,"inputTokens":5000,"outputTokens":2000}}
```

Handle these by checking the `method` field on incoming messages alongside the existing `hook/*`, `tool/*`, and `command/*` patterns.

## Key implementation notes

1. **Flush stdout after every write.** Buffered output will cause the engine to hang waiting for responses.
2. **Handle unknown hooks gracefully.** The engine sends all 55 hooks to subprocess extensions. Return null for hooks you don't care about.
3. **Respect the RPC timeout.** The engine drops calls that don't respond within the configured timeout (default: 30 seconds, configurable via `timeouts.extensionRpcMs` in `engine.json`).
4. **Never write non-JSON to stdout.** Debug output goes to stderr.
5. **Parse the `_ctx` field** from hook and tool params if you need session context (cwd, model, config).
6. **Use unique IDs for outgoing requests.** Start from a high number (e.g., 100000) to avoid collisions with engine-assigned IDs.

## Compiled binary extensions

For compiled languages (Go, Rust, C, etc.), build a static binary named `main`:

```bash
# Go
go build -o main .

# Rust
cargo build --release && cp target/release/my-ext main

# C
gcc -o main extension.c
```

Place the binary in the extension directory. The engine executes it directly without any runtime dependency.

## Resources, Notifications, and Cross-Session Messaging

Raw-protocol extensions access the resource subsystem, notifications, and cross-session messaging via these JSON-RPC methods. Send them as requests (with an `id`) and read the response from stdin.

### ext/declare_resource

Declare a resource collection for this extension. Call once at startup (inside or shortly after `init`).

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100010,"method":"ext/declare_resource","params":{"kind":"tasks"}}
```

Response: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100010,"result":{"ok":true}}`

### ext/publish_resource

Publish a resource operation. Routes to the global broker when `item.conversationId` is empty, session broker otherwise.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100011,"method":"ext/publish_resource","params":{"op":"update","item":{"id":"task-1","conversationId":"conv-1","title":"Updated"}}}
```

`op` is one of `"create"`, `"update"`, `"delete"`, `"mark_read"`.

Response: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100011,"result":{"ok":true}}`

### resource/query

The engine calls this method on your extension when a client subscribes to a resource kind you declared. Respond with the current full collection.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"method":"resource/query","params":{"kind":"tasks"}}
```

Response:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"result":{"items":[{"id":"task-1","title":"Do the thing"},{"id":"task-2","title":"Do another thing"}]}}
```

### ext/notify

Send a push notification through the engine/relay pipeline.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100012,"method":"ext/notify","params":{"kind":"task_complete","title":"Task finished","body":"Analysis complete.","sound":true}}
```

Response: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100012,"result":{"ok":true}}`

### ext/list_sessions

List sessions running the same extension type.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100013,"method":"ext/list_sessions","params":{}}
```

Response:

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100013,"result":{"sessions":[{"key":"abc-123","hasActiveRun":true,"extensionName":"my-ext","conversationId":"conv-1"}]}}
```

### ext/send_to_session

Send a structured message to another session. The engine enforces same extension type. The target session's `session_message` hook fires with `{senderSessionKey, kind, payload}`.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100014,"method":"ext/send_to_session","params":{"targetKey":"abc-123","kind":"task_update","payload":{"taskId":"t-1","status":"done"}}}
```

Response: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100014,"result":{"ok":true}}`

### ext/intercept

Emit an `engine_intercept` event on a target session's stream. The engine stamps `interceptSource` from the calling extension's name.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100015,"method":"ext/intercept","params":{"level":"banner","title":"Task complete","message":"The analysis finished.","targetSessionKey":"abc-123"}}
```

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `level` | string | yes | `"banner"` (informational) or `"redirect"` (urgent) |
| `title` | string | yes | Short headline |
| `message` | string | no | Body content |
| `targetSessionKey` | string | no | Target session; defaults to caller's session |
| `metadata` | object | no | Opaque map forwarded to clients unchanged |

Response: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100015,"result":{"ok":true}}`

### ext/run_once_check

Check whether this instance should execute a cross-instance dedup operation.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100016,"method":"ext/run_once_check","params":{"id":"daily-sync","debounceMs":60000}}
```

Response: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100016,"result":{"execute":true,"reason":""}}` or `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100016,"result":{"execute":false,"reason":"debounced"}}`

### ext/run_once_complete

Record the outcome of a dedup operation. Call after `ext/run_once_check` returned `execute: true`.

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100017,"method":"ext/run_once_complete","params":{"id":"daily-sync","failed":false}}
```

When `failed` is `true`, the lock is released without updating the last-run timestamp so the next instance retries immediately.

Response: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":100017,"result":{"ok":true}}`
