# Ion Engine

Ion is a headless AI agent runtime. Single Go binary (~9MB), zero runtime dependencies. It runs as a daemon on a Unix socket or TCP port, speaks NDJSON, and executes LLM-driven agent loops with tool use, branching conversations, and a 55-hook extension system.

14+ LLM providers via raw HTTP (no SDKs). 14 core tools. 4-layer config merge with enterprise sealing. Extensions in any language via JSON-RPC 2.0.

## Who is this for?

### IT Admins and Platform Engineers

Deploy Ion across teams with enterprise configuration, MDM policy enforcement, and sealed provider settings. Control which models, tools, and extensions are available.

- [Enterprise configuration](enterprise/)
- [Security model](security/)
- [Configuration reference](configuration/)

### Harness Engineers

Build agent behavior on top of the engine using hooks, tools, and extensions. The engine executes; your harness decides what happens.
