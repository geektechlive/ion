# Agents

Agents are delegated tasks that run their own tool loops. When the primary session encounters a problem that benefits from isolated context or a different model, it spawns a child agent via the `Agent` tool. The child runs to completion and returns its text output to the parent.

## How agents work

1. The LLM calls the `Agent` tool with a prompt and working directory.
2. The engine creates a child `ApiBackend` with its own run loop.
3. The child streams LLM calls, executes tools, and iterates until done.
4. The child's text output flows back to the parent as the tool result.
5. The parent continues its own tool loop with the agent's output.

Parent and child share the same event bus. Events from child agents are forwarded to connected clients so UIs can show agent activity in real time.

## Agent types

### Inline agents (Agent tool)

The `Agent` tool spawns a child session on the fly. No agent definition file needed. The parent provides the prompt and working directory directly in the tool call. This is the most common pattern.

### Disk agents (definition files)

Agents defined as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. These are discovered at startup and available by name. Disk agents let you define reusable specialists with specific models, tool allowlists, and system prompts.

### Extension-dispatched agents

Extensions can dispatch agents programmatically via `DispatchAgent` on the extension context. This supports the same options as disk agents but is triggered from extension code rather than the LLM.

## Agent state tracking

The engine tracks agent lifecycle through `engine_agent_state` events. Each agent gets a name, status (`running`, `done`, `error`, `cancelled`, `idle`), and metadata including elapsed time and a summary of its output. Clients use these events to render agent panels.

Each event is a **complete snapshot** — consumers replace their local view rather than merging incremental updates. See [Agent State Contract](../architecture/agent-state.md) for the normative semantics.
