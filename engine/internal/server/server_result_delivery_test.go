// TestWriteToClientBlocksUntilSpace pins the result-delivery contract
// (dd79e162): writeToClient routes a line through the client's state queue and
// must BLOCK until there is space rather than dropping the line. Command
// results (start_session {ok:true}, etc.) flow through this path; dropping one
// left the desktop waiting 30s for a response that never arrived. The blocking
// select also has a done escape hatch so an evicted client cannot wedge the
// caller forever.
//
// Revert-test contract: reintroducing the non-blocking `default:` drop branch
// makes "delivered after space frees" go red — the line would be dropped
// instead of delivered once the queue is full.

// registerClientWithQueue installs a clientWriter for conn with a state queue
// of the given capacity, WITHOUT starting a drain goroutine, so the test fully
// controls when the queue drains.
