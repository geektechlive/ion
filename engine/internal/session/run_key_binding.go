// Stable runID -> session-key binding for event routing.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Every NormalizedEvent the backend emits is routed to its session by
// keyForRun(runID). Before this binding, keyForRun resolved the key by
// scanning sessions for one whose engineSession.requestID matched the runID
// (see keyForRun in helpers.go). That coupling is fragile: requestID is a
// transient field that currentSessionStatus clears mid-run when the backend
// momentarily "disclaims" a still-live run (manager.go:
// `currentSessionStatus: clearing stale requestID ... (backend disclaims
// run)`). When that clear races an in-flight emit, the scan returns "" and
// handleNormalizedEvent drops the event before it reaches any consumer.
//
// The observed production failure: an auto-dispatched run that flipped to plan
// mode mid-run emitted PlanModeChangedEvent{Enabled:true} exactly while
// requestID was transiently cleared. The event was dropped, the desktop never
// learned the session entered plan mode, and the permission-mode pill silently
// fell back to "auto". That is one victim of a general defect — ANY in-flight
// event (tool results, text chunks, agent-state snapshots) emitted in that
// window was equally droppable.
//
// THE FIX
//
// runKeyBindings is a stable runID -> key map that is independent of the
// transient requestID. It is set at dispatch (when the run is registered),
// consulted first by keyForRun, and cleared only at the authoritative terminal
// points (handleRunExit, and the early-abort paths that assign requestID = ""
// without ever starting a run). Routing therefore no longer depends on the
// requestID field surviving every concurrent status query.
//
// All three accessors take m.mu (the same lock that guards `sessions`) so the
// binding and the session map never disagree under concurrency.

// bindRun records the runID -> key association for an active run. Called at the
// dispatch seam where engineSession.requestID is assigned. Caller must hold
// m.mu (write).
func (m *Manager) bindRunLocked(runID, key string) {
	if runID == "" {
		return
	}
	m.runKeyBindings[runID] = key
	utils.Info("Session", fmt.Sprintf("bindRun: runID=%s -> key=%s (event-routing binding set)", runID, key))
}

// unbindRun removes the runID -> key association. Called at the authoritative
// terminal points: handleRunExit (normal/abnormal run end) and the early-abort
// dispatch paths that clear requestID without starting a run. Idempotent —
// unbinding an absent runID is a no-op. Acquires m.mu (write).
