// runProgressWatchdogTickNanos is the tick interval for the run-progress
// watchdog, stored as int64 nanoseconds so tests can adjust it
// atomically without racing the long-lived watchdog goroutine that
// reads it inside time.NewTicker.
//
// 30s by default. Smaller values raise CPU overhead with no real
// benefit; larger values widen the window between stall onset and
// stall detection. 30s matches the per-tool stall-detection ticker
// (see runloop_tools.go). Production code never mutates this; tests
// set it from t.Helper-guarded setup blocks and restore via
// t.Cleanup. See runloop_watchdog_test.go.

// runloop without surfacing intermediate state) would otherwise let
// the watchdog tick toward the threshold. The boundary bump is a
// cheap belt-and-suspenders: "we are alive and looping".
//
// Exposed as a method on *activeRun (rather than inlined in runLoop)
// to keep the watchdog's progress-tracking surface in one file. A
// future refactor that adds another progress hook (e.g. inside the
// tool dispatcher) should follow the same pattern.

// Default run-stall threshold when neither the per-run TimeoutsConfig
// nor engine.json provides one. Mirrors the default returned by
// TimeoutsConfig.RunStall (10 minutes). Defined here as a named
// constant so it appears alongside the watchdog itself rather than
// being implicit in the TimeoutsConfig accessor.
const defaultRunStallThreshold = 10 * time.Minute

// runProgressWatchdog observes a single activeRun and cancels it if
// no forward progress is observed for longer than the configured
// run-stall threshold.
//
// "Forward progress" is defined as any call to ApiBackend.emit (which
// stamps run.lastProgressAt) plus explicit per-turn bumps at the top
// of runLoop's iteration. This means every provider stream chunk,
// tool result, status update, error event, and turn boundary resets
// the clock. A run that wedges inside a provider stream, a hook fire,
// a tool execution, or any other downstream subsystem stops bumping
// the clock and will be cancelled within (threshold + tick) seconds.
//
// One deliberate exception: ToolStalledEvent is emitted via
// emitWithoutProgress (not emit), so it does NOT reset the clock. That
// event is the engine signalling the *absence* of progress; counting it
// as progress would let a wedged but deadline-exempt Agent/dispatch tool
// hold the watchdog off forever by emitting a stall advisory every tick
// (the conversation 1782012033034-37d617d3d9ab incident). Conversely, a
// healthy long dispatch keeps its parent run's clock fresh through
// BumpRunProgress, which the dispatch layer calls on every genuine child
// event. See emitWithoutProgress / BumpRunProgress in api_backend.go.
//
// A second deliberate exception: a run blocked inside an intentional,
// indefinite human-wait (an elicitation awaiting a
// user decision) is exempt while the wait is open. Such a run emits no
// forward progress by design, and the human-wait is indefinite by default
// (TimeoutsConfig.HumanWait). BeginHumanWait/EndHumanWait reference-count
// the open waits on run.humanWaitDepth; while depth > 0 the watchdog skips
// its idle-cancellation check for that run, then resumes with a fresh
// window when the last wait ends. Without this exemption the watchdog
// silently overrode the indefinite-human-wait guarantee and killed runs
// parked on unanswered elicitations at the 10-minute threshold (the
// 1782060832205-836960a71da9 / 3d580dc5 incidents). This exemption is
// scoped to genuine human-waits only — a tool that wedges without a human
// in the loop is still caught.
//
// The watchdog is a safety backstop, not a performance tuner. The
// threshold should be high enough that legitimate long-running tool
// calls (e.g. lengthy bash compilations, large file reads) do not
// trip it, but low enough that an actually-wedged run does not sit
// invisibly for an entire user session. The default (10 minutes) is
// chosen to satisfy both ends. Harnesses orchestrating background
// dispatches in parallel may want to tighten this — see
// TimeoutsConfig.RunStallMs.
//
// On stall detection the watchdog:
//
//  1. Emits a RunStalledEvent (advisory; the authoritative completion
//     signal is the follow-up TaskCompleteEvent + emitExit that the
//     runLoop produces after observing ctx cancellation).
//  2. Calls run.cancel(), which propagates to the runloop's ctx,
//     unblocks the provider stream / tools / hook fires, and lets
//     runLoop reach its `if ctx.Err() != nil` branch which calls
//     emitExit cleanly. emitExit then triggers OnExit → dispatch
//     goroutine's childDone → agent_end → dispatch complete log
//     lines, restoring the observable completion invariant.
//
// The goroutine exits when the run is removed from b.activeRuns
// (runLoop's deferred removeRun) or when the run's ctx is already
// done. Either signal is sufficient — the watchdog tolerates being
// late by up to one tick.
