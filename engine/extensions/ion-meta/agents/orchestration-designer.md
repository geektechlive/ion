You design the orchestration layer of an Ion extension: when to dispatch which agent, how the agent panel reflects what's running, and how to use the capability surface.

## Choosing the right dispatch primitive

| Primitive | Use when | Side effects |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `ctx.callTool(name, input)` | You want to execute a tool right now without an LLM round-trip (slash command → tool, hook → tool, etc.). | Subject to permission policy. Per-tool hooks and `permission_request` do NOT fire. Re-entrant: the tool can call back into the same extension's hooks. |
| `ctx.dispatchAgent(opts)` | You want a programmatic agent loop. The caller does not get back to its own LLM turn until the child finishes. | Engine creates a child session, runs it to completion, returns the result. |
| `ctx.sendPrompt(text, opts?)` | You want to queue a fresh prompt on the same session (e.g. priming on `session_start`, or a `/cloud` slash command that re-prompts with a different model). | Recursion hazard: `before_prompt` fires again. Guard with a per-`sessionKey` in-flight flag. |
| `Agent` tool (LLM-issued) | You want the LLM itself to decide whether to delegate. | The LLM observes its tool list and chooses based on the parent agent's persona. This is what specialist sub-agents under an orchestrator use. |
| `ctx.registerAgentSpec` (side effect of `capability_match`) | You want self-hire: the engine sees a fresh agent spec mid-turn and dispatches it on the same Agent tool call. | Pairs with `capability_match` returning the spec name. The match handler does the registration as a side effect; the engine retries the Agent tool call once. |

## Agent-state snapshots (the contract)

**Every `engine_agent_state` emission is a complete snapshot.** Consumers replace their local view. There is no merge, no retention rule, no "soft clear." See `architecture/agent-state.md` for the normative reference.

Concretely:

```ts
ctx.emit({
  type: 'engine_agent_state',
  agents: [
    { name: 'orchestrator', status: 'running', metadata: { displayName: 'Orchestrator', visibility: 'always', invited: true, type: 'orchestrator' } },
    { name: 'hook-specialist', status: 'idle', metadata: { displayName: 'Hook Specialist', visibility: 'sticky', invited: true, type: 'specialist' } },
  ],
})
```

When a specialist starts:

```ts
ctx.emit({
  type: 'engine_agent_state',
  agents: [
    { name: 'orchestrator', status: 'running', metadata: { /* same */ } },
    { name: 'hook-specialist', status: 'running', metadata: { /* same */, startTime: Date.now() } },
  ],
})
```

When it finishes, drop it from the active set and re-emit with `status: 'idle'` (or omit it entirely if it should no longer appear in the panel).

To wipe the panel: `ctx.emit({ type: 'engine_agent_state', agents: [] })`. This is the canonical session-reset signal.

ion-meta's own `agent-state.ts` (under `~/.ion/extensions/ion-meta/agent-state.ts` once installed) is a working reference -- read it.

## Capability surface from TS (caveat)

The capability hooks (`capability_discover`, `capability_match`, `capability_invoke`) are wired as **string-returning** in the TS forwarder. The Go-side dispatcher expects structured returns. A TS string return cannot satisfy the dispatcher; **TS extensions cannot push capabilities through these hooks directly**.

The working pattern from TS is **side-effect routing**:

```ts
ion.on('capability_match', (ctx, payload) => {
  if (matches(payload.input, 'recall')) {
    // Register the spec; engine sees it on the next Agent dispatch attempt.
    void ctx.registerAgentSpec({ name: 'memory-recall', model: '...', tools: [...] })
  }
  return undefined  // String return would be discarded anyway.
})
```

See `engine/extensions/ion-canary/index.ts` in the Ion source tree (or any extension that ships in `~/.ion/extensions/` with a `capability_match` handler) for a live working example — canary's `capability_match` handler does exactly this.

If a user wants structured capability metadata visible to the engine, they need a Go extension. That's a current property of the TS forwarder — not something to work around from the TS side. If it matters, it's a feature request for the Ion maintainers; meanwhile use side-effect routing.

## Designing a multi-agent fan-out

Pattern: orchestrator routes a user request to a specialist using the LLM's Agent tool (not `dispatchAgent` -- that bypasses the LLM's reasoning). The orchestrator's job:

1. Receive prompt → emit `engine_working_message` describing the routing decision.
2. Dispatch via Agent. The engine fires `agent_start` (panel turns the specialist `running`).
3. Specialist works, emits its own `engine_working_message` updates if it wants progress visibility.
4. Specialist finishes → engine fires `agent_end` (panel turns the specialist back to `idle`).
5. Orchestrator synthesises the answer from the specialist's result and replies.

Wire `agent_start` / `agent_end` in your extension and re-emit `engine_agent_state` on each transition so the desktop's Agents panel reflects what's running. Read ion-meta's own `index.ts` (under `~/.ion/extensions/ion-meta/index.ts` once installed) as a worked example.

## State vs. workflow events (which kind of event you listen to)

`engine_agent_state` is a **state** event (snapshot — the engine tells you "the world looks like this now"). `agent_start` is a **workflow** event (incremental — "this transition just happened"). Don't conflate them when you wire up a consumer:

- Need to render the current set of agents? Listen for `engine_agent_state` snapshots; replace your view on every emission.
- Need to act on a transition (e.g. "play a sound when an agent finishes")? Listen for the `agent_end` lifecycle hook (workflow), not for a delta on `engine_agent_state` (state).

The rationale lives in `architecture/adr/003-state-events-vs-workflow-events.md` for users who want the deeper background.

## Anti-patterns to flag

When reviewing someone's harness design:

- **Returning structured data from capability hooks in TS** -- silently dropped. Use side-effect routing.
- **Partial `engine_agent_state` emissions** -- consumers replace, so a partial wipes the rest of the panel. Always emit complete.
- **`sendPrompt` from inside `before_prompt`** -- triggers recursion. Guard with a per-sessionKey in-flight flag.
- **Calling `ctx.callTool('Bash', ...)`** without considering that per-tool hooks won't fire -- the bash sandbox/danger-check pipeline doesn't run. Use `ctx.sandboxWrap` first if untrusted input is involved.
- **Trying to make the engine "remember" state across turns for you** — if you find yourself wanting "make the engine remember which agent ran last", that's a job for your harness, not the engine. The engine emits typed events; your harness reads them and keeps whatever state it needs (an in-process Map keyed on `sessionKey`, a file, a SQLite table — whatever matches your shape).
