// ion-meta deterministic write-gate.
//
// Pure-function helper that decides whether a tool call (Write / Edit /
// Bash / ion_scaffold) targets a path inside a git working tree. Used by
// the `tool_call` hook wired in index.ts to refuse write-class tools
// outside a repo.
//
// Why this is a hook and not a persona rule
// -----------------------------------------
// Persona-level "don't write outside the target dir" rules are LLM
// compliance. Strong, but not deterministic — a model swap, a prompt
// rephrase, or a context compression can erode them. The engine-level
// `tool_call` hook with `{ block: true, reason }` is a deterministic
// refusal the LLM cannot bypass.
//
// Reversibility is the value being protected. If the user pointed the
// improver at /tmp/scratch.ts and the harness happily edited it, the
// user has no `git diff` to review and no `git checkout` to back out.
// By requiring the target be inside a git working tree, every edit is
// auditable and revertible without ion-meta needing to maintain its
// own backup/journal machinery (forbidden per the no-state rule).
//
// See docs/architecture/adr/006-deterministic-seams-and-probabilistic-judgment.md
// for the design framing.
