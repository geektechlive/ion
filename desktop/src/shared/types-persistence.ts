 *
 *  - `clear`      — the user cleared context (in-place `/clear`, same id; or the
 *                   Implement-plan clear-context cut, which mints a new id).
 *  - `compaction` — a compaction event split the session (optional: today
 *                   compaction is in-place and does NOT append; reserved for a
 *                   future compaction-driven split).
 *  - `fork`       — a tree-navigation fork branched the conversation.
 *  - `unknown`    — migration backfill for pre-ledger `conversationIds[]` chains
 *                   whose original cut reason was not recorded.
