/**
 * Resolve the conversationId an extension-hosted tab should resume on restore.

 * This is the root-cause fix for the "agent starts fresh after restart" data-loss
 * regression. The prior logic resolved only `inst.conversationIds[last]` →
 * `st.conversationId`; when both were empty it omitted `sessionId` from
 * `engineStart`, and the engine pre-minted a brand-new EMPTY conversation, which
 * the desktop then adopted as the tab's identity — orphaning the real
 * conversation on disk.
 *
 * Resolution priority (first non-empty wins):
 *   1. `inst.conversationIds[last]`  — the instance's most-recent conversation.
 *   2. `st.conversationId`           — the tab-level conversation id.
 *   3. `st.lastKnownSessionId`       — the last id the tab was ever bound to
 *                                      (survives even when conversationId was
 *                                      transiently cleared).
 *   4. `inst.conversationIds[0]`     — the oldest id in the instance chain, a
 *                                      last resort before giving up.
 *
 * Phantom-id guard (#230/#231): when an `exists` predicate is supplied, every
 * candidate is filtered through it so a "phantom" id — one pre-minted by the
 * engine on a prior restart and never saved (no backing file) — can NEVER be
 * selected. This is the desktop half of the phantom-resume fix: the morning's
 * data loss happened because an empty phantom got appended to `conversationIds`,
 * so `[last]` resolved to the newest phantom on every restart, the engine could
 * not load it, pre-minted another phantom, and the chain self-propagated.
 * Filtering by on-disk existence breaks the chain: we resolve to the most-recent
 * id that actually has a conversation file, skipping phantoms entirely.
 *
 * When `exists` is omitted (callers that cannot probe disk, or pure unit tests
 * of the raw priority order), the resolver falls back to the unfiltered walk —
 * preserving the original behavior. The restore caller always supplies `exists`.
 *
 * Returns '' only when NONE of these is available (or all candidates are
 * phantoms). A '' result must NOT be passed to engineStart as a fresh session —
 * see restoreSingleInstanceTab, which refuses the sessionless start when the
 * instance has persisted history.
 *
 * Exported for unit testing the resolution order at a stable seam.
