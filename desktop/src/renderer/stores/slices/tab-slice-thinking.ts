/**
 * Apply a per-conversation thinking-effort change to the active conversation.
 * Extracted from tab-slice.ts to keep that file under the 600-line cap.
 *
 * DATA-driven, no tab-type fork: the effort lives on the active conversation
 * INSTANCE for every tab (a plain conversation's single `main` instance, an
 * extension-backed tab's active instance). The unified `submit` reads it from
 * the instance at prompt-submit time and rides it on the next send_prompt as
 * `thinkingEffort` (live, no restart). There is no engine call here — unlike
 * permission mode, the effort is a per-prompt override, not a session command.
