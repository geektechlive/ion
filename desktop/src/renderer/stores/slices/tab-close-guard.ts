/**
 * tab-close-guard — pure predicate for the closeTab action-layer guard.
 *
 * Extracted from tab-slice.ts (file-size cap). The closeTab action calls
 * {@link evaluateCloseGuard} before tearing a tab down; when the result is
 * `blocked`, the action returns early and the close is refused.
 *
 * ─── Action-layer guard ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Hard-block conversation tab close while the orchestrator is running OR
 * dispatched background agents are still executing. Mirrors the X-button
 * suppression in TabStripTabPill.tsx and exists for defense-in-depth — it
 * catches keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+W → CloseTabConfirmDialog), group-pill close
 * paths, and any future entry point we haven't enumerated.
 *
 * No escape hatch: there is no `force` flag. Either the tab is completely idle
 * (no orchestrator activity, no dispatched background children) and close is
 * allowed, or the tab is active and the user must stop it first (via the in-pane
 * Interrupt button, or by waiting for natural completion). The user's path to
 * close an active tab is: interrupt → wait for idle → close. This protects
 * dispatched background agents from accidental SIGTERM via tab close.
 *
 * Internal cleanup paths (tab close after the single engine instance is torn
 * down) abort the orchestrator above the call site, which propagates to children
 * — by the time those paths reach this guard, the tab's state should already be
 * quiescent. If a race window means agents haven't yet flipped to terminal
 * status, the guard fires, the warn is logged, and the next snapshot tick (after
 * agents finish aborting) allows the close.
 *
 * TAB-TYPE-AGNOSTIC: the guard applies to every conversation tab, plain or
 * extension-hosted. The Agent tool dispatches background sub-agents regardless
 * of whether a harness is loaded, so a plain conversation can have running
 * children too — the dispatched-agent kill footgun is not engine-tab-specific.
 * The fold reads per-instance statusFields.state + agentStates (the same
 * agnostic data isAnyEngineInstanceRunning / anyEngineInstanceHasRunningChildren
 * in TabStripShared.ts read), and collapses correctly for a single-`main`-
 * instance plain tab. (A prior `tabHasExtensions` gate here excluded plain tabs
 * and let Cmd+W silently kill their running sub-agents — fixed.)
