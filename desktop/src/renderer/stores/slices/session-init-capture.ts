 * Capture a session_init's sessionId onto an instance: append it to the raw

 *
 * The cut reason is whatever a checkpoint handler stamped on the instance
 * (pendingCutReason) — e.g. Implement clear-context sets 'clear' — defaulting
 * to 'unknown' for the engine's own session lifecycle. appendCut is idempotent
 * on the newest id, so repeated session_inits for the same id never duplicate;
 * parentId linkage falls out of appendCut. The one-shot pending reason is
 * consumed (cleared) when used.
 *
 * Returns {} when the id is already in the chain (nothing to capture). The
 * caller force-flushes persistence on a non-empty return so the id survives a
 * crash between emission and the debounced persist window.
 *
 * Extracted from event-slice.ts to keep that reducer under the 600-line cap.
