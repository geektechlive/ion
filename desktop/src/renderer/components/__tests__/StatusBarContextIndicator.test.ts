/**
 * Tests for the StatusBarContextIndicator's local percent recomputation.
 *
 * The component's job is to render a percent + tooltip showing how much
 * of the conversation's context window is used. The bug fixed in
 * plan cosy-pacing-bee.md (and Commit 3 of this branch) is that the
 * indicator was dividing engine-reported `contextTokens` by the
 * *picker-selected* model's nominal window, producing a 100% reading
 * whenever the picker disagreed with the engine (e.g. an Opus-running
 * conversation displayed under a Sonnet picker selection: 498k / 200k).
 *
 * The fix anchors the denominator to the engine's reported
 * `contextWindow` (now plumbed onto the tab state) and only falls back
 * to the picker model's window when the engine has not yet answered.
 *
 * We test the pure math in isolation by reproducing the component's
 * formula here. The React rendering is intentionally not tested — the
 * formula is the contract, the rendering is incidental.
