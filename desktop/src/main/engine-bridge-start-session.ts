/**
 * startSession — bridge attach handshake.
 *
 * Lives in its own file because the bridge's primary class file is at
 * its 600-line cap and this handshake is the natural seam: it sequences
 * three independent steps (session-id injection from prior conversation,
 * `start_session` dispatch, post-start reconcile) that don't touch any
 * other bridge state.
 *
 * Why a post-start reconcile:
 *
 * The engine's `start_session` is idempotent. When a desktop attaches to
 * an engine that already has this session loaded (daemon reuse, desktop
 * reinstall, reconnect after socket flap), the engine returns a bare
 * `{ ok: true }` immediately — it does not re-emit the in-flight state
 * (active agents, pending AskUserQuestion / ExitPlanMode denials, last
 * context %, etc.). Without an explicit snapshot request, the desktop
 * has no way to populate its renderer-side state for an
 * already-running session.
 *
 * `ReconcileState` (engine/internal/session/manager.go) is the canonical
 * reconnect handshake. It re-emits `engine_agent_state` and
 * `engine_status` (including the pending PermissionDenials field) on
 * the same key. The renderer's engine-event-slice already translates
 * those snapshots into `tab.permissionDenied`, agent rows, footer
 * values, etc. — so calling reconcile after start_session closes the
 * "card never re-appears after desktop reinstall" gap end-to-end.
 *
 * Lifecycle / idempotence:
 *
 *   - We register the session in `activeSessions` BEFORE the dispatch
 *     so reconnect logic (_reRegisterSessions) sees it on the next
 *     socket recovery.
 *   - Reconcile is fire-and-forget. The engine's `reconcile_state`
 *     handler doesn't return a body; the snapshot arrives as ordinary
 *     `engine_*` events on the existing event subscription. The renderer
 *     subscribes once at bridge wireup, so it picks them up automatically.
 *   - On a start_session failure we skip reconcile — the session isn't
 *     known to the engine yet, so there's nothing to snapshot. Logged so
 *     the failure-then-no-reconcile path is reconstructable from logs.
 *
 * Logging:
 *
 * Every step is logged at INFO with the session key and resolved config
 * highlights so the attach cycle is reconstructable from `~/.ion/desktop.log`
 * without a debugger. Both branches of the post-start conditional log —
 * "requesting reconcile_state post-start" or "skipping reconcile (start
 * failed: ...)" — so a grep for `reconcile_state` covers every attach.

/**

 *
 * Lives here next to startSession because it shares the same resume affordance:
 * a tracked conversationId is injected as config.sessionId so the engine resumes
 * the prior conversation rather than minting a new one. Combined with the
 * engine-side binding store and the desktop B1 divergence guard, this keeps a
 * tab bound to its original conversation across an engine restart (#230/#231).
 *
 * Fire-and-forget per session: a failed re-register is logged and skipped so one
 * bad session does not block recovery of the others.
