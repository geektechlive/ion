/**
 * Single write+broadcast helper for desktop settings.
 *
 * Per docs/engine-grounding.md §6 — "Both edit surfaces funnel through the
 * same main-process write helper — exactly one persistence + broadcast
 * path" — this module is the canonical home for the two operations both
 * edit surfaces (the renderer's SAVE_SETTINGS IPC handler and the iOS
 * `set_desktop_setting` wire command handler) share:
 *
 *   1. Persisting `settings.json` atomically.
 *   2. Broadcasting a fresh `desktop_settings_snapshot` to every paired
 *      iOS device when any projectable key changed.
 *
 * Before this module existed, the two edit surfaces each had their own
 * write + broadcast logic — `ipc/settings.ts` for the renderer path and
 * `remote/handlers/desktop-settings.ts` for the iOS path — with subtly
 * different gating (the renderer path diffed against the prior settings
 * and skipped the broadcast when no projectable key changed; the iOS
 * path always broadcast). Centralising both call sites here makes the
 * "exactly one path" claim literal and gives the audit log one prefix
 * (`[SETTINGS] persistAndBroadcast`) to grep for.
 *
 * Snapshot semantics are inherited from the underlying wire event —
 * consumers REPLACE their cached projection wholesale on every
 * `desktop_settings_snapshot`; never merge. See the contract docs in
 * `projectable-settings.ts` and `docs/architecture/desktop.md` for the
 * full snapshot rules.

/**
 * Broadcast a fresh `desktop_settings_snapshot` to every paired device.
 *
 * Cheap to call: reads `settings.json` once and emits one wire event.
 * Safe to call when no transport is attached (no-op). Logs the broadcast
 * so the operational log shows exactly which call sites triggered a
 * snapshot.
 *
 * Most callers should prefer `persistAndBroadcastSettings()` which gates
 * the broadcast on projectable-key changes. This standalone broadcast is
 * exposed for the rare cases where the schema or grouping shape has
 * changed without a settings-value change (e.g. a future hot-reload of
 * the projectable allowlist), or for unconditional refreshes from
 * higher-level pairing code.

/**
 * Persist a new settings object and broadcast to paired iOS devices if
 * any projectable key changed.
 *
 * The two edit surfaces call this:
 *
 *   - Renderer SAVE_SETTINGS IPC (`ipc/settings.ts`) passes the full
 *     in-memory settings as `next` and the prior on-disk shape as
 *     `prev`. The diff against the projectable allowlist determines
 *     whether a broadcast is necessary.
 *
 *   - iOS `set_desktop_setting` wire command (`remote/handlers/
 *     desktop-settings.ts`) passes a merged object as `next` and the
 *     pre-merge shape as `prev`. Validation has already gated the key
 *     against the allowlist by this point — the diff still runs so the
 *     broadcast is skipped when iOS posts a no-op write (same value
 *     it already had).
 *
 * `prev` MUST be the pre-write snapshot; pass `{}` when there is no
 * prior state (the first write on a fresh install). Passing `null`
 * forces a broadcast regardless of the diff — useful for code paths
 * where the caller already knows a broadcast is required (e.g. a
 * schema reload) but persistence still needs to go through this
 * helper for the single-path guarantee.
 *
 * Throws when `writeSettings` throws — atomic write failures are
 * surfaced to the caller rather than swallowed. The broadcast is
 * skipped on write failure to keep the in-memory wire state consistent
 * with the on-disk truth.
 *
 * Logging: every call logs the projectable-key delta. Verbose by design
 * — settings writes are infrequent and the log line is the audit trail
 * the user sees when they ask "what just changed on my paired devices?".
