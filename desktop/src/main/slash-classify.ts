/**
 * Slash-command classification helper.
 *
 * Extracted from prompt-pipeline.ts to keep that orchestrator file under
 * the 600-line cap. This module owns the one non-orchestration helper the
 * slash branch of the pipeline calls:
 *
 *   `dispatchExtensionCommand` — sends the slash to the engine's command
 *   registry and awaits the result event. The engine resolves its own
 *   extension-command table; the desktop is purely a courier here.
 *
 * Local `.md` template expansion has been RETIRED: the engine now OWNS
 * slash resolution + expansion (template lookup across `.ion/commands`,
 * `.claude/commands`, skills, and project roots, plus $ARGUMENTS
 * substitution and frontmatter handling). On `unknown_command`, the
 * pipeline re-submits the raw invocation to the engine with
 * resolveSlash=true rather than expanding locally — see
 * `prompt-pipeline.ts:handleSlash`.
 *
 * `dispatchExtensionCommand` does not call back into the orchestrator: the
 * seam between this file and prompt-pipeline.ts is one-way (orchestrator →
 * helper → engine bridge), matching the rest of the helper layer.
 *
 * Companion file: `slash-parse.ts` owns the canonical slash regex and the
 * `ParsedSlash` type. This file imports the parsed result; it does NOT
 * re-parse.

/**
 * Returns true when a slash command is the **first** prompt on a fresh tab —
 * where "fresh" means "since the last freshness checkpoint".
 *
 * Used by the slash branch of prompt-pipeline.ts to decide whether to flip the
 * tab from plan→auto before forwarding a slash command. The plan→auto switch is
 * a DESKTOP policy (a slash command means "run this task", incompatible with
 * plan mode) — the engine does not own it; the client that toggles plan mode on
 * the session is responsible. The flip itself lives in `handleSlash`
 * (prompt-pipeline.ts); this predicate is the pure first-prompt test it consults.
 * What counts as a checkpoint (i.e. what resets `promptCountSinceCheckpoint`
 * back to 0, restoring "fresh" status):
 *
 *   - `EngineControlPlane.resetTabSession` — full session reset.
 *   - `EngineControlPlane.notifyConversationCleared` — fired when `/clear`
 *     succeeds. The engine keeps the same `conversationId` after `/clear`
 *     (it's a checkpoint, not a session restart), so this guard CANNOT rely
 *     on `conversationId` being null to recognize a freshly-cleared tab.
 *
 * "Not fresh" is driven by two signals on the tab entry:
 *   1. `resumedSavedConversation === true` — the tab's tracked conversationId
 *      came from RESUMING A SAVED conversation (caller-supplied id on restore),
 *      not from a fresh engine mint. This replaces the old "any non-null
 *      runOptions.sessionId ⇒ resumed" heuristic, which mis-classified a
 *      brand-new eagerly-started session (whose engine-minted id the renderer
 *      also sends as runOptions.sessionId) as resumed — the bug that ran a
 *      first-prompt `/align` in plan mode. See resumedSavedConversation in
 *      engine-control-plane-events.ts for scenarios B (resume) vs C (mint).
 *   2. `promptCountSinceCheckpoint > 0` — at least one prompt has been
 *      submitted in the current checkpoint window.
 *
 * Edge-cases:
 *   - `getTabStatus(tabId)` returns `undefined` → tab not yet registered,
 *     i.e. genuinely fresh. Returns true.
 *   - `clearedSinceLastPrompt` → `/clear` just fired; treat as fresh.
 *
 * @param tabId The active tab id.

 *
 *   - `commandError === ""`                → engine ran the command, done
 *   - `commandError === "unknown_command"` → re-submit with resolveSlash=true
 *   - any other `commandError`             → surface as a system message
