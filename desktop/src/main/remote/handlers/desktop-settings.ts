/**
 * Wire handler for `set_desktop_setting` commands from iOS.
 *
 * iOS sends `set_desktop_setting { key, value }` when the user toggles a
 * row in the Settings tab. This handler:
 *
 *   1. Validates the key against the allowlist in
 *      `desktop/src/main/projectable-settings.ts`. Unknown keys are
 *      silently rejected (logged + no write).
 *   2. Validates the value's runtime type matches the declared type.
 *      Wrong-type values are silently rejected (logged + no write).
 *   3. Reads the current settings, merges the change, and persists +
 *      broadcasts through the single helper
 *      `persistAndBroadcastSettings` in `settings-broadcast.ts`. That
 *      helper is the canonical write+broadcast path shared with the
 *      renderer SAVE_SETTINGS handler — engine-grounding §6's "exactly
 *      one persistence + broadcast path" guarantee is enforced by
 *      routing both edit surfaces through the same function.
 *
 * Rejection is silent because iOS already has the previous value cached
 * — failing to write produces no observable client effect, and a
 * malformed write is a programming error iOS should fix rather than
 * something the user needs to be told about.
