 * the Go engine (see `engine/internal/session/command_registry.go`). The cache
 * is a routing HINT for the unified prompt pipeline, not a source of truth:
 *
 *   - HIT  → "this name is registered with extensions on this session,
 *            dispatch confidently."
 *   - MISS → "either the name is not an extension command OR our snapshot is

 *            engine resolves the live table at dispatch time and emits
 *            engine_command_result with CommandError='unknown_command' if it
 *            disclaims the name. The pipeline falls through to `.md`
 *            expansion on that signal."
 *
 * Snapshot semantics: every event REPLACES the prior entry for the key. An
 * empty `commands: []` payload is the authoritative "no extension commands
 * live for this session" signal — we delete the cache entry on empty so a
 * subsequent re-population creates a fresh entry. See AGENTS.md §4.
 *
 * Entries are populated reactively from engine events; never written by
 * dispatch code. Reads are O(1) Set.has lookups, called once per slash
 * command parsed by the unified pipeline.
