# Changelog

Notable user-facing and contract-affecting changes to Ion. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning is per-component; the engine, desktop, relay, and iOS app ship independently. Entries here cover whichever component(s) the change touched.

## Unreleased

### Engine — soft-breaking contract changes

These changes are shipped as `feat(engine)` rather than `feat!(engine)` per the maintainer's accepted scope; the breakage is bounded to known consumers and the migration paths are documented below. Third-party harness authors should treat this section as the public migration guide.

- **Early-stop continuation is now opt-in.** The engine previously shipped with `earlyStopContinue.enabled = true` and a baked Claude-Code-style continuation prompt. It now ships with `enabled = false` and supplies no default text. To restore the old behavior:
  - **Desktop users:** toggle "Early-stop continuation nudge" on in the General settings tab. The desktop bundles a reference policy implementation in [`desktop/src/main/early-stop-policy.ts`](desktop/src/main/early-stop-policy.ts) that the toggle controls.
  - **Third-party harnesses:** wire `before_early_stop_decision` (subprocess) or respond to `engine_early_stop_decision_request` (socket) and supply your own `ContinueMessage`.
  - **Operators running the engine bare:** add a minimal extension that registers `before_early_stop_decision`, or accept that early-stop continuation will not fire.

  See [ADR-002](docs/architecture/adr/002-engine-vs-harness-early-stop.md) for the full rationale.

- **`engine_plan_mode_changed{enabled: false}` no longer fires when the model calls `ExitPlanMode`.** Consumers that listened to this event to detect a plan-exit proposal must migrate to the new `engine_plan_proposal{kind: "exit"}` event. The new event carries `planFilePath` and `planSlug` directly so consumers no longer need to scrape `permissionDenials.toolInput` to recover them. The `engine_plan_mode_changed` event continues to fire on confirmed state transitions (harness `SetPlanMode`, run start with `PlanMode: true`, plan-mode abort, user-approval chokepoint).

  See [ADR-003](docs/architecture/adr/003-state-events-vs-workflow-events.md) for the state-vs-workflow split that motivated the change.

- **`EnterPlanMode` re-entry guard now driven by `RunOptions.ImplementationPhase`.** The previous mechanism — the desktop prepending an "implementing a user-approved plan" sentence to the user prompt that the `EnterPlanMode` tool docstring instructed the model to recognize — has been replaced by a structured `RunOptions.ImplementationPhase` bool. The desktop sets the flag when the user clicks Implement; the engine skips injecting the `EnterPlanMode` sentinel tool entirely for that run. No prompt-text substring matching is required. Third-party harnesses doing implement-then-execute flows should set `RunOptions.ImplementationPhase = true` on the implementation run; the model will not see the `EnterPlanMode` tool and cannot re-propose plan mode.

- **`EnterPlanMode` tool description moved to harness.** The 18-line policy prose previously baked into `engine/internal/tools/enter_plan_mode.go` (WHEN to enter plan mode, WHAT is allowed once enabled, WHEN NOT to enter) now lives in the harness. The engine ships only a one-line neutral fallback (`"Switch the current session into plan mode."`) and a new `RunOptions.EnterPlanModeDescription` field on the wire. Harnesses set the field on every `send_prompt` to override the fallback. The desktop ships the previous prose as the `ENTER_PLAN_MODE_DESCRIPTION` constant in `desktop/src/main/prompt-pipeline.ts` and applies it automatically on every engine-tab prompt, so user-facing behavior is unchanged. Third-party harnesses copy the desktop's constant or write their own prose suited to their workflow (TUI, domain-specific framing, etc.).

  See [ADR-004](docs/architecture/adr/004-enter-plan-mode-prose-in-harness.md) for the full rationale.

### Engine — additive

- New event variant `engine_plan_proposal` (kind-discriminated; `"exit"` initially). See [Server Events](docs/protocol/server-events.md#engine_plan_proposal).
- New event variant `engine_early_stop_decision_request` carrying the wire-protocol surface for the `before_early_stop_decision` hook so socket-only harnesses can participate without running a subprocess extension.
- New client command `early_stop_decision_response` complementing the request event.
- New hooks: `before_plan_mode_enter`, `before_plan_mode_exit`, `before_early_stop_decision`, `early_stop_continued`, `system_inject`, `before_provider_request`, `workspace_file_changed`.
- New shared type `EngineCommandListing` carried inside `engine_command_registry` snapshots.
- New `RunOptions.EnterPlanModeDescription` field (and its socket-wire mirror `ClientCommand.EnterPlanModeDescription`) for the harness-supplied `EnterPlanMode` tool description per ADR-004. Additive `omitempty` — third-party harnesses that don't set it inherit the engine's one-line neutral fallback.

### Desktop

- New setting `enableEarlyStopContinuation` in the General settings tab. Defaults to `false`. Toggle on to opt into the Claude-Code-style "keep working" nudge — the desktop's `early-stop-policy.ts` replies to the engine's `engine_early_stop_decision_request` event with a ContinueMessage when the setting is on.
- New module `desktop/src/main/early-stop-policy.ts` implementing the reference policy for the `engine_early_stop_decision_request` wire event.
- `engine_plan_proposal` is now the primary first-class signal for plan-exit approval cards. The existing permission-denial card-render path keeps working as a back-compat fallback.
- **Desktop settings projection to iOS.** New module `desktop/src/main/projectable-settings.ts` defines the allowlist of 12 boolean preferences (early-stop nudge, AI-generated titles, expand tool results, show TODO list, Claude Code compat, bash command entry, auto-group movement, scroll on tab switch, close explorer on file open, open Markdown in preview, editor word-wrap, hide on external launch). Two new wire types: `desktop_settings_snapshot` (event, snapshot semantics) and `set_desktop_setting` (command). Settings written from iOS round-trip through the desktop's validation + persistence path and broadcast back to every paired device. The snapshot carries the projection schema (type, group, label, description, defaultValue) so iOS auto-renders new settings without a Swift change.

### iOS

- Decodes `engine_plan_proposal` cleanly (the desktop is the authoritative consumer; iOS observes for diagnostic visibility).
- Decodes `engine_early_stop_decision_request` cleanly (same posture — desktop responds, iOS observes).
- **Desktop Settings tab section.** The Settings tab gains a "Desktop Settings" NavigationLink row that pushes a per-desktop detail screen titled with the active desktop's display name. The detail screen renders the projection schema as Apple-style grouped sections with toggle rows. iOS shows settings for the currently-connected desktop only — to edit a different paired desktop, switch transports first.

### Architecture documentation

- New ADRs: [ADR-002](docs/architecture/adr/002-engine-vs-harness-early-stop.md) (engine-vs-harness for early-stop continuation), [ADR-003](docs/architecture/adr/003-state-events-vs-workflow-events.md) (state events vs workflow events).
- `docs/engine-grounding.md` gains a new "Forbidden (breaking)" bullet codifying that stopping the emission of an existing event on one of its established triggers is a breaking change, even when the wire shape is unchanged.
- `docs/architecture/agent-state.md` gains a "Related contracts" section that generalizes the snapshot-replace pattern beyond the agent-state example.
