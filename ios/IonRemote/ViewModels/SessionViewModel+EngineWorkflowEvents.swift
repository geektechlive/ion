// MARK: - Engine Workflow Event Handlers (observe-only)
//
// Extracted from SessionViewModel+EventHandlers.swift to keep that file
// under the 600-line cap and to give the cluster of observe-only engine
// workflow events one home.
//
// These events arrive from the desktop (which is the authoritative consumer
// for all of them) purely so the wire protocol stays uniform across consumers
// — every engine event the desktop sees, iOS sees. iOS does not act on any
// of them today; each handler exists so the switch in `handleEvent(_:)`
// stays exhaustive and so future iOS features that *do* want to render UI
// for these events have a single, well-known place to add behavior.
//
// Current events handled:
//   - enginePlanProposal             — workflow signal that the model has
//                                      proposed a plan-mode transition
//                                      (currently only kind="exit"). Desktop
//                                      gates the actual mode flip via its
//                                      approval UI; see ADR-003.
//   - engineEarlyStopDecisionRequest — engine ↔ harness wire-protocol
//                                      request emitted when the engine wants
//                                      an external opinion on whether to
//                                      nudge a model that has stopped below
//                                      the configured output-token budget.
//                                      Desktop's early-stop-policy.ts
//                                      responds via the
//                                      early_stop_decision_response command;
//                                      see ADR-002.
//   - engineCommandRegistry          — complete snapshot of slash commands
//                                      exposed by the session's loaded
//                                      extensions. Desktop's prompt pipeline
//                                      uses this as a routing-hint cache;
//                                      iOS does not yet consume the registry
//                                      for autocomplete (intentionally out
//                                      of scope for the unified slash-
//                                      pipeline phase).
//   - engineCommandResult            — fired at the end of every
//                                      Manager.SendCommand dispatch.
//                                      Desktop awaits it to decide between
//                                      "dispatch landed" and "engine
//                                      disclaims, fall through to .md
//                                      expansion".
//
// Diagnostic visibility: DiagnosticLog.logEvent fires for every event the
// switch dispatches, so these handlers don't need to log anything. Add
// per-handler logging only if a real behavior change requires it.

        // otherwise no-op. A future iOS surface (e.g. a "Plan
