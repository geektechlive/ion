// MARK: - Unified prompt submit & model override
//
// Extracted from SessionViewModel+Commands.swift to keep that file under the
// Swift 600-line cap after the #256 follow-up collapsed the engine-vs-plain
// submit / setModel forks into single branch-free paths (the unified bodies
// grew the optimistic-insert + documentation that pushed Commands.swift over
// the cap). See CLAUDE.md → "When a file exceeds the cap": split along natural
// seams rather than collapsing comments. Submit + model override is a cohesive,
// self-contained group, so it splits cleanly here.
//
// The whole point of this file is the "no behavior branches on tab type"
// standard: `submit` and `setModel` each have exactly ONE code path and emit
// ONE wire command for every conversation tab — plain or extension-backed. The
// only per-tab difference is DATA (the `instanceId` field on `.prompt`), never
// a fork.

extension SessionViewModel {

    /// Unified prompt submit (#256 follow-up). Every conversation tab — plain
    /// or extension-backed — submits through this SINGLE path. There is no
    /// engine-vs-plain code fork: the only difference is DATA.
    ///
    /// - Wire command: always the unified `.prompt` (`desktop_prompt`).
    /// - `instanceId`: the lone per-tab DATA difference. The desktop's
    ///   `handlePrompt` routes a prompt into the engine pipeline iff the wire
    ///   carries an `instanceId` (`cmd.instanceId !== undefined`), and into the
    ///   CLI pipeline otherwise. So an extension-backed tab — which has an
    ///   active conversation instance — passes that instance id, while a plain
    ///   CLI tab omits it. This is expressed as a data field (present/absent),
    ///   not a branch on tab type: `resolveSubmitInstanceId` returns nil unless
    ///   the tab is engine-hosted, and a nil `instanceId` is simply dropped from
    ///   the encoded JSON (`encodeIfPresent`).
    /// - Optimistic insert + pinned prompt + status are all driven the same way
    ///   for both tab types; attachment-marker content is built whenever
    ///   attachments are present (data), independent of tab type.

        // insert.

        // The insert fires UNCONDITIONALLY (no `conversationLoaded` gate). The
        // previous gate skipped the insert on fresh or just-reloaded conversations

        // and the history response had not yet returned — producing a MISSING
        // bubble until the desktop echo arrived over the relay round-trip. This
        // was near-guaranteed on a brand-new conversation's first prompt.

        // Removing the gate is safe: `mutateConversationMessages` calls
