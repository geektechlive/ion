// MARK: - Dispatch cache invalidation on new engine session
//
// When the engine binary is replaced (e.g. a bug-fix build installed and
// restarted), iOS holds stale per-dispatch snapshots from the old engine.
// The terminal-skip guard in loadAgentDispatchConversation treats any cached
// agentSnapshotByConvId entry as permanent authority, so a truncated snapshot
// produced by an old engine (e.g. the limit=50 cap) is trusted forever and
// the dispatch popup shows empty tabs that never self-heal.
//
// ## Trigger: StatusFields.sessionId change
//
// The engine embeds a per-session identifier in `StatusFields.sessionId`
// (carried by `engine_status` / `desktop_session_status` events). This ID is
// a conversation key (`<timestamp>-<hex>`) minted when the engine starts a new
// session and does NOT change across snapshot ticks or routine reconnects to
// the same session. It changes only when:
//   a. the engine process restarts (new binary, crash recovery), or
//   b. the user starts a genuinely new engine session on that tab.
//
// Both cases invalidate all cached dispatch snapshots: the new engine may
// return more complete data for conversations the old engine truncated.
//
// ## What is cleared
//
// On a sessionId change for any tab, ALL dispatch caches are cleared (not
// just that tab's). All dispatch snapshots share the same convId keyspace, and
// any convId may have been fetched from the old engine. The cleared maps:
//
//   - agentSnapshotByConvId       — stale file-backed snapshots (may be truncated)
//   - agentConversationMessages   — merged transcripts derived from them
//   - agentDispatchActivity       — push buffers (empty after terminal cleanup,
//                                   but clear defensively to avoid orphaned ids)
//   - agentDispatchSeqs           — seq arrays in lockstep with agentDispatchActivity
//   - terminalClearedDispatches   — edge-gate set; must be cleared so a new load
//                                   can flow through clearTerminalDispatchCaches
//   - agentConversationLoading    — in-flight guard; cleared so fresh loads are
//                                   not blocked by a stale "loading" sentinel
//   - activeDispatchIdByConvId    — convId→dispatchId mapping; no longer valid
//
// ## Flicker risk: none
//
// The popup reads from agentConversationMessages. After clearing, the next
// loadAgentDispatchConversation call (which fires on every popup open when
// the snapshot is absent) issues a fresh load from the new engine. There is
// no intermediate frame where the popup shows empty: the popup was already
// showing empty (the bug), or it triggers a fresh load immediately and shows
// "Loading…" while waiting — which is the correct behaviour for data that
// hasn't been fetched yet.
//
// ## Routine reconnects: not triggered
//
// Transport-level reconnects (e.g. LAN link drop + rejoin) reconnect to the
// SAME engine session, so the sessionId does not change. The clear fires only
// on a strict string inequality between the old and new sessionId. Sessions
// that have never emitted a sessionId (pre-engine or CLI tabs) are skipped
// (empty-string guard).

    ///     repeated recomputeDispatchTranscript calls on every subsequent tick.
    ///
    ///   - Before clearing the push buffer, compare the merged transcript
    ///     (snapshot + push) against the snapshot alone. When the merge is
    ///     more complete, the snapshot is truncated (e.g. an old engine with a
    ///     50-message cap). In that case the push buffer is the only source of
    ///     the missing content, so we DEFER the clear: issue a fresh file load
    ///     and keep the push buffer intact. The response handler
    ///     (handleAgentConversationHistory) will replace the snapshot authority
    ///     with the full data, at which point the next recomputeDispatchTranscript
    ///     call will drop the now-covered push entries naturally.
    ///
    ///   - When the snapshot is already complete (merged == snapshot count, or
