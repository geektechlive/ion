// MARK: - ContextBreakdownPayload
//
// Wire types for the desktop_context_breakdown event (plan modest-leaping-waffle §9).
// These mirror TypeScript's ContextBreakdownCategory + ContextBreakdownPayload in
// desktop/src/shared/types-engine.ts and Go's ContextBreakdownCategory +
// ContextBreakdownPayload in engine/internal/types/engine_event.go.
//
// Cross-language contract: update ContractSyncTests.swift whenever the Go struct
// gains a field (go test ./internal/types/ -run TestContractManifest -update and
// then mirror the new field here).

// MARK: - ContextBreakdownCategory

/// resolution tier. Mirrors Go's ContextBreakdownCategory and TypeScript's
/// ContextBreakdownCategory in types-engine.ts.
