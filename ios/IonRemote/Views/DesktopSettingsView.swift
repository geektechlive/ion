/// footer that carries the per-setting description prose. Unknown

/// under a fallback "Other" section so older iOS builds never crash
/// on a schema they don't recognize.

/// Per-desktop scoping: this view binds to `viewModel.desktopSettings`,
/// which is always the snapshot from the currently-active pairing.
/// The navigation bar title surfaces the desktop's display name so the
/// user always knows which machine they're editing — matches Apple's
/// own pattern (Settings → Wi-Fi → [network] → detail page titled with
/// the network name).

/// Edits round-trip through the wire: tapping a toggle calls
/// `viewModel.setDesktopSetting`, which sends `set_desktop_setting` to
/// the desktop. The desktop validates, persists, and broadcasts a
/// fresh snapshot back. The view re-renders on the snapshot, so a
/// rejected write (unknown key, wrong type) simply causes the toggle
/// to bounce back to its prior state on the next snapshot. No optimistic
/// state is maintained — the desktop is the source of truth.
